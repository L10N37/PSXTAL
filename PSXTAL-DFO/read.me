proto stage, PSXTAL as stand-alone DFO using the same parts but as a proper modboard.

Will release source code and PCB files when tested and finished.


UPDATE: this board is nearly ready. Need to increase footprint size of the Caps and resistors, remove a couple unnecessary footprints (MCU xtal/cap) and change the code as it breaks i2s comms between the clock gen IC and the MCU when using lower MCU clock freq. Just too busy atm. There is a mixture of xtals in this footprint when it comes to pinouts as well. This board will actually short gnd / power with some brands.
