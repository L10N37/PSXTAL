for DUAL SMD XTALS

I can't source an NTSC XTAL the original boards size and the PAL ones are MOQ 1000, they also don't have an NC leg. 
You'd need to run a link from 1Y_PAL/ 2YNTSC down to the XTALS NC PAD.

Either way, this original board seems to be impossible to source parts.


The other will use the standard XTAL size off the PS1 mainboard.
