# PSXTAL
just learning arduino, this took a while for me to be happy with it. Complete noob here.
the code simply looks for a keypress combination and routes VCC to either Digital Pin 7 or 8.
The idea is to switch XTALS in a console to swap between NTSC/PAL video modes.
No idea how I'm going to implement it in the console, it will likely need heavy modification.
