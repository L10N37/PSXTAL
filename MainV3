// wasn't even thinking about this code and it just came to mind that there was an if, else if, else in the main.. realised it could just be swapped
// to if (ntsc) else (pal)
// as oppose to if (no keypress / then PAL, else if  keypress / then NTSC / else PAL) but then I decided to do a restructure, it literally took 2 minutes
// and it's much better now
// Now we hold the key combo for 2 seconds, then release and there's a smooth transition back and forth. Prior if you held the combo it would eventually switch
// even whilst still  holding the key combo and I also couldn't work out why every now and then it would jump from NTSC to PAL sooner than the delay function
// should have permitted (but never the other way around). Seems to be fixed.

//V3. Tidied it up, shaved a couple percent off total size (actually back to 1% smaller). Still no relevance to when it's finished but If i couldn't optimise
// this a little I don't think I stand a chance going further with the project as it gets difficult soon as PS2X isn't working.. next is serial monitor stuff
// involving a lot of PSX/PS2 specific controller interface tech stuff.. wish me luck

//Now a single START+SELECT combo and a few second delay until a mode change
