This version uses the ADAFRUIT SI5351 I2C Arduino clock generator to switch between NTSC and PAL clocks on the same clock-out pin on the fly, suitable for PU18/PU8 models
that still use an actual crystal as oppose to a clock synthesiser (like this)

I will make a version for later models eventually, it will output both the subcarrier for PAL/ NTSC (for colour composite/S-Video) and the correct GPU frequency for 50/60hz.
The PU8/PU18 subcarrier is derived from a division of the GPU clock, hence, on these versions of PS1 the subcarrier will be correct with just one clock providing 2 different outputs :)

This was only made due to running out of NTSC XTALs and a mass delay on shipping from overseas!
